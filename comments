  Responsive styling!
  Cool idea to open a modal window
  I'm confused about the appendText function
  Modal window has "text" as title
  Clicking on the submit button at the bottom opens the modal but also opens 6 alerts
  The comments are super helpful, I like "do you expect this to do something else?"
  Where is verb2 in the end text?

Nice nav bar!

  Wow that color picker is awesome! How does it work? I can't find the code
